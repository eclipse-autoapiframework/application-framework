### VSS import (vafvssimport)

The `vafvssimport` package allows to import a VSS-based data catalogue into module interfaces and
datatypes of the internal Vehicle Application Framework (VAF) model. The importer requires the JSON
data export from VSS.

Each branch of the tree-like VSS model is converted to a nested module interface. The
parent branches are used as namespace for the current interface. All child elements of a branch are
represented as data elements of that interface. If these elements are branches by themselves, they
are imported as structs, while leaves result in primitive types.  
With this structure, the user is able to either access individual leafs of the VSS
catalogue by using one of the nested interfaces, or complete branches by working with the structs of
interfaces that sit higher in the hierarchy.

VSS supports restrictions on input values of parameters. For numeric datatypes, a range can be
specified, while string parameters support a list of allowed values. The numeric ranges are imported
into the VAF model as is, while the allowed string values are converted to enums for better
usability. VSS allows a maximum size to be specified for array types. Parameters with this attribute
set are imported as fixed-size arrays, while those without are imported as vectors.
