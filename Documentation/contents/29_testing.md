# Testing

## Unit tests (GoogleTest)

The Vehicle Application Framework (VAF) assist with GoogleTest-based unit testing of application
modules by generating test skeletons and mocks for all used interfaces. The idea is that the writer
of a unit test can mock any input/output of the interfaces to produce test cases that verify the
actual application code without having to connect to real or simulated external test communication
partners. The generated test project builds together with generated test-specific base code, which
vastly simplifies the writing of the unit test.

Unit tests are activated by default but can be disabled with the following flag that needs to be
passed to the preset stage:
```
vaf make preset -d -DVAF_BUILD_TESTS=OFF
```

The test code, which can be edited and extended by the user is located in the file:  
`<app-module project directory>/implementation/test/unittest/src/tests.cpp`

One example skeleton test case is generated for reference. It is up to the user to adapt it and add
further tests. Writing a test case consists of 4 steps:

1. Test case creation.
```
TEST_F(AppModule1UnitTest, Test_1) {
```
2. Create mock objects of interfaces as used by the application.
```
auto HvacStatusConsumerMock = std::make_shared<demo::HvacStatusConsumerMock>();
auto DataExchangeProviderMock = std::make_shared<demo::DataExchangeInterfaceProviderMock>();
```
3. Write expected outcome of the test, i.e., what you want to test.
```
EXPECT_CALL(*DataExchangeProviderMock, RegisterOperationHandler_MyFunction(_)).Times(1);
```
4. Create an application module object using above created interface mocks.
```
auto AppModule1 = std::make_shared<demo::AppModule1>( demo::AppModule1 ::ConstructorToken {
    HvacStatusConsumerMock,
    DataExchangeProviderMock});
}
```

## SIL tests (SIL Kit)

Software In the Loop (SIL) testing is supported using [Vector SIL
Kit](https://github.com/vectorgrp/sil-kit). Any interface modeled in Configuration as Code (CaC) can
be selected to be routed via SIL Kit. SIL Kit uses a registry application, which acts as a message
broker. In other words, all messages must go through that router. The connection to SIL Kit in the
VAF is configured using CaC and is done similar to other interface connections. Only difference, one
has to connect to the SIL Kit registry by specifying the registry URI and instance name of the
communication interface. Providers and consumers that want to connect should configure the same
instance name and URI.

CaC snippet connecting an interface to an application module using SIL Kit:
``` python
demo_app.connect_consumed_interface_to_silkit(
    Appmodule1, # The application module
    Appmodule1.ConsumedInterfaces.VelocityServiceConsumer, # The connected interface
    "Silkit_VelocityService", # Instance name used to identify the interface in SIL Kit registry
    "silkit://192.168.128.129:8500" # URI of the running SIL Kit registry to connect to
)
demo_app.connect_provided_interface_to_silkit(
    Appmodule2, # The application module
    Appmodule2.ProvidedInterfaces.VelocityServiceProvider, # The connected interface
    "Silkit_VelocityService", # Instance name used to identify the interface in SIL Kit registry
    "silkit://192.168.128.129:8500" # URI of the running SIL Kit registry to connect to
)
```

VAF utilizes [Protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/) to serialize the data such that communication
partners on any type of platform easily can serialize or deserialize the payload. Proto files are
generated for all defined datatypes and interfaces. These proto files are then compiled using the
protoc compiler. Further, transformers get generated for each type to enable easy translation
between protobuf types and VAF types.
